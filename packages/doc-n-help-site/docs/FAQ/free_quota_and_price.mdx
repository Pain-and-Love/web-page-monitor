## Free points {#free-quota}
For free users, the number of points is reset to 80 every 30 days.  

Paid users, i.e. those with more than 80 points, will not have their points added or reset automatically.   
Points will be added at the next point increase time only after your points are below 80.  

1 point is enough to perform one check.  

If you check a page twice a day, you can have enough points for a month.  

## Task number and script number limit {#task-n-script-limit}
